Project Motivation:
It's to understand how does Airbnb work in San Francisco. We can understand 
1. Which neighborhood has most number of listings present?
2. Which neighborhood has highest host response rate and acceptance rate?
3. How are superhosts performing than other hosts in response?
4. Do we see any difference between superhosts and hosts acceptance rate at neighborhood with highest and lowest acceptance rate?
5. How does the price range in lowest and highest number of listings neighborhoods?
6. Which neighborhood has the top positive review?

Files uploaded:

- listings.csv - File contains listings data

- reviews.csv - File contains reviews data

Summary:

- We can see most of the listings at Downtown/Civic Center followed by Mission, South of Market and Western addition neighborhoods
- Diamond Heights, Seacliff, Golden Gate Park, Presido having similar kind of response rate.
- Seacliff neighborhood can be one of the top choice if we look at acceptance and response rate but looks like we can see that Seacliff has lower number of listings too
- We can understand that Outer Sunset and Mission seem to have high number of comments received from the users
- Chinatown has most of the positive reviews among all.
